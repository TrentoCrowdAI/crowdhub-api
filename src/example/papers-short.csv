The aging population is expected to increase two-fold by 2050. It is anticipated that there will not be enough caregivers to assist the elderly very soon, and thus, researchers are looking at various technologies and potential applications that will help alleviate the problem of elderly care. This chapter examines one such assistive technology: conversational agents in the form of avatars or robots as an aid to decrease loneliness and depression among the elderly and increase the cognitive function and quality of life. The authors discuss the state-of-the-science of research prototypes and commercial off-the-shelf systems. They propose a novel concept and design, and the authors discuss the ethical ramifications of senior citizens possibly bonding with inanimate objects as if they were human companions. © 2017, IGI Global.","Book Chapter","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021381114","short","0-U","0"

Previous work has focused mostly on general and static rules that can be applied to robotics, such as proxemics. How can we deal effectively and efficiently with the dynamic positioning common in social interactions, such as the leaning behaviors we observed in conversations between elderly with hearing problems? We propose to refine the existing approach by having a robot continuously adapt its positioning behavior based on the reactions people give to its earlier actions - i.e. by making the robot responsive to feedback cues. To implement such a responsive system, we will have to develop systems for the detection of these feedback cues, as well as strategies to adapt the robot's behavior based on them. © 2017 Author.","Conference Paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016445286","short","0-U","0"

Learning to use new technologies can help older adults to be included in today's digital society. However, learning to use new technologies is not always easy, especially for older adults. This study focuses on how older adults learn to use a specific technology, tablet computers, and the role that social support plays in this process. Data for this project are from 21 in-depth interviews with individuals who own tablet computers. We examine how older adults engage with tablet devices and increase their digital literacy. The findings suggest that, for older adults to start to use tablets, social support plays an important role. In addition, a key way that many participants report gaining expertise with the technology is through ""playing around"" with the tablets. Suggestions for how to help older adults learn to use new technologies are detailed. © Southern Gerontological Society.","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85002196310","short","0-U","0"

A Social Networking Service (SNS) like handover support system for elderly care facilities was installed in a facility and has replaced the conventional hand-written handovers and is in real operation in care facilities for more than 3 years. The authors have conducted quantitative/qualitative analysis, depth interview to the employees and managers to assess the effect of adopting ICT system for knowledge management of non-routine information with high stickiness. The contribution of this study is as follows. In this case study, we confirmed that socio-technological approach is one of the CSFs for adopting KM in SMEs.

During a four month pilot project, six residents were supervised to learn how to competently Facebook. Findings indicate that older people are able to connect and learn the use of new technologies with which they may be unfamiliar. While high levels of user enjoyment were found, measures of social connectedness resulting from the use of Facebook use were inconclusive.

We obtained three types of evidence. The results show differential patterns of Web 2.0 tool use in relation to age, sex and educational level. Users reported benefits in relation to autonomy, motivation, social dimension, social participation, mood, self-esteem, and physical and mental health generally, and differences were observed according to age, educational level and type of tool. We also obtained differential psychological profiles for users of different tools that could determine usage patterns and derived benefits.

As a counter to this view, we examine the practices of older adult bloggers (N=20) through in-depth interviews. We study this group of older adults as a unique case of content creation and sharing. We find that the practice of creating and sharing through blogging meets several important psychological and social needs for older adults. Specifically, blogging supports the development of identity in older adulthood; fosters selfexpression that supports older adults' values; provides meaningful engagement during retirement; and enables a sense of community and social interaction that is important for wellbeing in late-life. We argue for a focus on designing for late-life development and detail opportunities for online systems to better support the dynamic experience of growing older through online content creation and sharing.","Conference Paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-84997531657","short","1-U","1"

The first concerns the different conceptions of old age held by the cyber-participants and the nonparticipants, and in particular, differing views on learning capacity in later life. The second is related to the varying conceptions of time in old age, and orientation to the past or to the future.
