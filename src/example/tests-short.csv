Nevertheless, it is vital to focus on the security issues and the tradeoff between privacy preserving and traceability. A novel security mechanism named as the traceable threshold attribute-based signcryption (TTABSC) can permits patients to be friends and make a proper tradeoff between privacy and traceability. The proposed scheme leverages a four-party model to prevent the leak of a patient's sensitive information, including symptom information, identity and patient's health information (PHI). Combining the digital signatures and encryption, we provide a series of performance analysis, including correctness, unforgeability, traceability and privacy. Compared with previous works, our most efficient scheme generates a constant signcryption size. © Copyright 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037824062","short","0-gold","0","no","TRUE","The paper proposes a security mechanism that can be applied in the context of mobile healthcare social networks.

Method: Participants (N = 76) were randomly assigned to receive 3 months training versus care-as-usual. Cognitive and mental health were assessed before and after the intervention. Results: Results show significant cognitive improvements across time in the training, but not control, group. This effect was mediated through a combination of increased social activity, improved self-competence, and maintained personal identity strength. Indirect effects on mental health outcomes via these processes were also observed.

It is vital, therefore, to provide support to informal caregivers in a manner that makes them more effective while, at the same time, easing the burden of constant caregiving. This work presents a prototype of an online support system for informal caregivers to the elderly and its evaluation. The prototype has multiple modules which provide services including patient and caregiver profile management, care recommendation and planning, treatment notification, an information archive, as well as social interaction with other caregivers.

Social technologies offer enormous potential for enhancing aged care, but research on their use in aged care has largely focused on institutional or informal care settings, rather than formal care in the home. Meanwhile, technologies for aging in place typically focus on monitoring and security, rather than psychosocial support. We conducted a field study in which aged care managers used a photo and message-sharing tool to communicate with clients living in their own homes. Our findings demonstrate that visual and social forms of communication are valuable for supporting psychosocial care-giving, but there are barriers to effectively adopting new communication tools in this setting. Time constraints inhibited care managers' use of the technology, which was also influenced by their efforts to carefully maintain boundaries between their personal and professional lives.","Conference Paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-84900406069","short","1-gold","1","yes","TRUE","The paper describes a study involving a photo and message sharing tool enable (online) communication between age care managers and their clients"

Results demonstrated that ethnic nursing homes, senior centres that provide programs and services, and homemaker services were respondents' major service needs. Multiple ordinary least-squares regression analysis revealed that respondents who emigrated from Mainland China and those who exhibited greater psychological well-being, reported being physically more mobile, perceived fewer service needs, and expressed satisfaction with the quality of their neighbourhood demonstrated higher levels of life satisfaction. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857790382","short","0-gold","0","no","TRUE","The paper does not discuss either technology or online social interactions"

An online survey was advertised through a newsletter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Qualitative analyses yielded four areas of caregiver concern: health of the care recipient over time, ability of caregivers to sustain support, social support available for the care recipient, and financial burden of care. Despite these concerns, few caregivers reported completed plans for future caregiving. One fourth of the caregivers had made no plans, nor had they discussed future caregiving with others. Although most would prefer other relatives to assume care in the event they could not sustain support, these expectations may not be communicated openly. Generating discussion on this pertinent topic has implications for the aging society regarding how best to care for those with SMI and their caregivers. © 2008 The Southern Gerontological Society.","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-48249088014","short","0-gold","0","no","TRUE","The paper does not discuss either technology or online social interactions"

To study effects of hostility on the risk of arterial hypertension (AH), myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in males aged 25-64 years. Materials and methods. A screening study of the population was performed in 1994 according to WHO program MONICA-psychosocial. The response in a random representative sample of 25-64-year-old males (n = 657) living in Novosibirsk was 82.1%. New cases of MI, AH and stroke were registered in the control periods 1994-2000, 1994-2002. Computer program package SPSS-10 was used for statistic processing. Cox regression model of the relative risk (RR) was employed. Results. Hostility was rather prevalent among the examinees (76.9%). MI risk for 8 years was 4.65 times higher in hostile men. Hostility was not associated with higher risk of AH and stroke. Hostility was seen more frequently in men with poor education, workers and retired persons. These groups are also at the highest risk of MI. Conclusion. Hostility raises MI risk in unstable society but had no effect on the risk of AH and stroke.","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-33750438406","short","0-gold","0","no","TRUE","The paper does not discuss either technology or online social interactions"

Using a sample of 15 workers ages 52 to 67 and a qualitative interview methodology, the authors determined that retention of employer-provided health care benefits may be a critical factor in encouraging older workers to remain on the job. Further, workers in this sample highly valued the opportunity for positive social interaction on their jobs and indicated that more flexible work schedules would be one change the employer could make that would have the most immediate impact on their decision to retire. They also said that more money, more recognition/appreciation, more autonomy, and more opportunities to develop skills and knowledge would potentially keep them on the job longer.

Also, both the immediacy and asynchrony of CMC helps them to construct real human relationships in the virtual community, including social connectedness to others as well as supportive and companionship relationships.
