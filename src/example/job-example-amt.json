There were large self-reported psychological effects related to positive changes in self perception. The game-play deepened social connections within the group and provided a basis for shared experiences with younger aged family members. Physically, the game-play showed significantly higher maximum energy expenditure (t = -4.52, p &lt; 0.05) than baseline, but no significant difference in overall energy expenditure. Findings from the quantitative data showed that Wii-play did not have substantial physical effects; nevertheless, qualitative data revealed that the participants perceived an improved sense of physical, social and psychological wellbeing. © International Journal of Emerging Technologies and Society 2010.</p>\n\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Does the paper describe a study that involves older adults?</strong></p>\n\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Yes &nbsp;( &nbsp;x &nbsp; ) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;( &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe &nbsp; &nbsp; ( &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Explain your decision.

By further developing the online program, it might be possible to foster behavioral changes that will positively affect hearing-aid users. Design: A randomized controlled study with two groups of participants. The intervention group underwent a five-week online intervention while the control group was referred to a waiting list. Questionnaires were used as outcome measures. Study sample: <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 218, 100);\">Seventy-six experienced hearing-aid users participated in the study, ranging in age from 26 to 81 years (mean 69.3 years)</span>.</span> Results: The findings showed significant improvements in the intervention group after the intervention, measured by the hearing handicap inventory for the elderly. The effects were maintained and improved at the follow-up. Furthermore, the results indicated that the participants in the intervention group improved at two items of the international outcome inventory for hearing aids, and the effects were partly maintained at the follow-up. Finally, significant improvements in the domain of psychosocial wellbeing were found at the follow-up. Conclusions: This study provides further evidence that the internet can be used to deliver intervention of rehabilitation to hearing-aid users. © 2014 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.</p>\n\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Does the paper describe a study that involves older adults?</strong></p>\n\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Yes &nbsp;( &nbsp; &nbsp; ) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;( &nbsp; &nbsp;x &nbsp; &nbsp;) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe &nbsp; &nbsp; ( &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Explain your decision.
