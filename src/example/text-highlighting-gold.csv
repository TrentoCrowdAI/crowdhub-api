Nevertheless, it is vital to focus on the security issues and the tradeoff between privacy preserving and traceability. A novel security mechanism named as the traceable threshold attribute-based signcryption (TTABSC) can permits patients to be friends and make a proper tradeoff between privacy and traceability. The proposed scheme leverages a four-party model to prevent the leak of a patient's sensitive information, including symptom information, identity and patient's health information (PHI). Combining the digital signatures and encryption, we provide a series of performance analysis, including correctness, unforgeability, traceability and privacy. Compared with previous works, our most efficient scheme generates a constant signcryption size. © Copyright 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037824062","short","0-gold","0","no","TRUE","The paper proposes a security mechanism that can be applied in the context of mobile healthcare social networks.

Method: Participants (N = 76) were randomly assigned to receive 3 months training versus care-as-usual. Cognitive and mental health were assessed before and after the intervention. Results: Results show significant cognitive improvements across time in the training, but not control, group. This effect was mediated through a combination of increased social activity, improved self-competence, and maintained personal identity strength. Indirect effects on mental health outcomes via these processes were also observed. Discussion: These findings suggest that Internet access and training can support the self and social connectedness of vulnerable older adults and contribute positively to well-being. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85036500594","short","1-gold","1","yes","TRUE","The paper describes a study involving Internet (technological component) training for social purposes (the social interaction aspect).","Some reasons","Objective: Guided by theoretical and empirical work attesting to the health benefits of social connections, we tested whether Internet connectivity, and training in its use for social purposes, can support the well-being of older adults receiving care.","Objective: Guided by theoretical and empirical work attesting to the health benefits of social connections, we tested whether Internet connectivity, and training in its use for social purposes, can support the well-being of older adults receiving care.Discussion: These findings suggest that Internet access and training can support the self and social connectedness of vulnerable older adults and contribute positively to well-being."
