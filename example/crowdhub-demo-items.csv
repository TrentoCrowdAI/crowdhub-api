Lewis L.,Using narrative with avatars and robots to enhance elder care,2017,"Healthcare Ethics and Training: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021381114&doi=10.4018%2f978-1-5225-2237-9.ch034&partnerID=40&md5=78b0a599b206aa2f2db0c4e1ad4db77e,"Elderly care is of increasing global concern. The aging population is expected to increase two-fold by 2050. It is anticipated that there will not be enough caregivers to assist the elderly very soon, and thus, researchers are looking at various technologies and potential applications that will help alleviate the problem of elderly care. This chapter examines one such assistive technology: conversational agents in the form of avatars or robots as an aid to decrease loneliness and depression among the elderly and increase the cognitive function and quality of life. The authors discuss the state-of-the-science of research prototypes and commercial off-the-shelf systems. They propose a novel concept and design, and the authors discuss the ethical ramifications of senior citizens possibly bonding with inanimate objects as if they were human companions. © 2017, IGI Global.",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021381114,short,0-U,0,,FALSE,,"Elderly care is of increasing global concern.

This preliminary qualitative study took place in a Melbourne-based elected Aged Care Facility. Facebook was accessed through desktop computers provided by the Facility. During a four month pilot project, six residents were supervised to learn how to competently Facebook. Findings indicate that older people are able to connect and learn the use of new technologies with which they may be unfamiliar. While high levels of user enjoyment were found, measures of social connectedness resulting from the use of Facebook use were inconclusive. The research con-cludes that when supported with appropriate teaching and technology, the use of computers to access Facebook is a practical approach in supporting the con-nectedness needs of the residents. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011958743,short,1-U,1,,FALSE,,"We explore the emotional effects of implementing Facebook in an aged care facility and evaluate whether computers and Facebook are of any benefit in regard to an elderly person's feeling of social connectedness.

A novel security mechanism named as the traceable threshold attribute-based signcryption (TTABSC) can permits patients to be friends and make a proper tradeoff between privacy and traceability. The proposed scheme leverages a four-party model to prevent the leak of a patient's sensitive information, including symptom information, identity and patient's health information (PHI).
